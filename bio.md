Basic Information

My name is Christian Armatas and I am a junior currently studying Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. I was born/raised in
Corvallis and I absolutely love this city and Oregon State University. 

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, working out, and longboarding around campus. I also love playing guitar,
cooking, and rock-climbing. I am very passionate and interested in the relation between computer science and the study of music
and audio-technology development. 

Programming Background

I have been programming since sophomore year in high school where I started on a simple object oriented language, Alice. Since coming to OSU, I have gained knowledge in a wide variety of programming languages including Python, C++, C, HTML, PHP, SQL, PureData, and more. My favorite assignment from 161/162 would have to be the battleship paired programming assignment my freshman year. The project took my partner and I days of trial, error, and eventually success which led to an overwhelming sense of pride.
