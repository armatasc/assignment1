Basic Information

My name is Christian Armatas and I am a junior currently studying Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. I was born/raised in
Corvallis and I absolutely love this city and Oregon State University. Initially I was a little skeptical about going to a college in my home town, but thus far my college experience has been very enjoyable. I have no regrets about my choice, especially considering the impressive resources OSU and the College of Engineering offer to students.

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, working out, and longboarding around campus. I also love playing guitar,
cooking, and rock-climbing. I am very passionate and interested in the relation between computer science and the study of music
and audio-technology development. 

Programming Background

I have been programming since sophomore year in high school where I started on a simple object oriented language, Alice. Since
coming to OSU, I have gained knowledge in a wide variety of programming languages including Python, C++, C, HTML, PHP, SQL,
PureData, and more. My favorite assignment from 161/162 would have to be the battleship paired programming assignment my
freshman year. The project took my partner and I days of trial, error, and eventually success which led to an overwhelming sense
of pride.

Computer Science is a very entertaining major for myself because I enjoy the rigor and sense of accomplishment the field offers,
as well as the logic and math components. As mentioned above, I am passionate about the relation between CS and the study of
music. Winter term 2014/15 I actually designed, coded, soldered, and 3D printed an entire functional synthesizer and casing.
This was possibly the most rewarding project I have ever completed and I hope to someday have a career doing related tasks.

Here is "some more content." I am starting to understand the ease of using GitHub and the importance of branching and merging. When working on a coding assignment, it would be very easy to make a branch to work on a new function, commit some changes, go back to understand where errors might have occurred, and merge the branch once finalized.
