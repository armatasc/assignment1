Basic Information

My name is Christian Armatas and I am a junior currently studying Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. I was born/raised in
Corvallis and I absolutely love this city and Oregon State University. Initially I was a little skeptical about going to a college in my home town, but thus far my college experience has been very enjoyable. I have no regrets about my choice, especially considering the impressive resources OSU and the College of Engineering offer to students.

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, working out, and longboarding around campus. I also love playing guitar,
cooking, and rock-climbing. I am very passionate and interested in the relation between computer science and the study of music
and audio-technology development.
